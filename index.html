      <h3>Welcome to my Digital Portfolio</h3>
      <p style="text-align:center">I do computer stuff</p>
      <p class="phome"> Hello, and welcome to my digital portfolio! Here you'll learn a bit about me and what makes me so great (but that should be obvious). This digital portfolio is important to me as it shows my growth and progression the past few years as I went from a novice computer science student to an individual with their foot in the game.</p>
      <p class="phome">Last year in computer science I learned a lot about how act like a person in the workplace environment. With our sudoku project, I learned how to work together as a team to meet our goals. With our schedule app project, I learned the struggle of putting a team on my back but some necessary skills such as CSS and HTML. And finally I had our ISP project where I learned how to mix my coding projects with actual hardware (which can be seen in the ISP tab).

      <p class="aboutme">Hi! My name is Alan Roybal but you may know me as Mr. Ben's favorite. I was born January 30, 2005 in Los Angeles California. I've lived the majority of my life in Allen, Texas and attend Allen High School currently. I am part of the International Baccalaureate program, a computer science 3 student, and a swim captain. Some of my hobbies are videogames, going to the gym, playing piano, and hanging out with friends.</h1>

			    <p>Concept - We implemented the Google Assistant API technology that smart mirrors utilize into an infinity mirror.</p>
			    <p>Motivation - To make something cool and practical in everyday life.</p>
			    <p>Conclusion - We never expected how difficult it would be having to change our plan when an unexpected challenge arised such as the lights we needed being out of stock.</p>
			    <p> Explantion - The code segment to the left shows how our Google API functioned once an activation phrase was spoken. The Google Assistant would then say that it is listening and wait until a response was spoken or timer shuts off the assistant. Google would then complete the request if given one and then shut down.</p>
